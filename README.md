Trivia game utilizing JavaScript and jQuery

This is a short trivia game based on the TV show "King of the Hill". Each question is timed, and at the end of the game the user is shown a summary screen with the number of correct, incorrect and unanswered questions.

The game code utilizes an object-oriented approach, with game functionality being controlled by a game object, and all questions represented as question objects which are organized into an array.
